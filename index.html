    <p>I'm Carlie and I'm a senior at Mizzou studying data journalism with minors in computer science and Latin. I'm currently the graphics editor for <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/" target="_blank">The Columbia Missourian</a>, lead teaching assistant for graphics at the <a href="https://journalism.missouri.edu" target="_blank">Missouri School of Journalism</a> and a research assistant in the <a href="https://ire.org/resource-center/" target="_blank">IRE resource center</a>.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Below are some projects I've developed and designed over the past few years.</p>

    <h3>The Dallas Morning News</h3>
    <h5>Restaurant Inspections (<a href="https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/restaurant-inspections-demo" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I developed a Django app from start to finish (with lots of help from my mentor Allan Vestal) that tracks restaurant health inspections across Dallas and Tarrant counties. The app is set to be published in late November.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Maps (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/maps" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I made several maps with Mapbox and a script that connects Google Sheets to an Amazon S3 bucket so the reporter could edit the data. My favorite is <a href="http://interactives.dallasnews.com/embeds/2017/skyline-map/" target="_blank">this one</a> that shows the history of skyscrapers in downtown Dallas.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Divine Nine embeddable (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/divine-nine-embed" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">For <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/life/life/2017/06/08/long-college-divine-nine-fraternities-sororities-lifeline-black-members" target="_blank">a story</a> about the Dallas Divine Nine, I worked with a reporter to develop an embeddable that showed facts about each chapter.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Book slider (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/book-slider" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I teamed up with another intern to develop <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2017/07/11/high-school-flashback-can-name-summers-reading-assignments-just-books-plots" target="_blank">this project</a> that tests reader's knowledge of summer reading books that North Texas schools were assigning. I used a jQuery plugin to make a series of image sliders where the top image was a synopsis of the book and the image underneath revealed the book cover, title and author.</p>

    <h3>The Columbia Missourian</h3>
    <h5>2016 election map (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/2016-Election-Map" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">For this map, I worked on a team to build a map of Missouri that displayed results from the U.S. presidential and senate races as they came in. I built the map with TopoJSON files and used D3 and Underscore.js to connect the data to it.</p>

    <h3>The Maneater</h3>
    <h5>A Historic Fall at MU (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/blob/master/A%20Historic%20Fall/mufall15.html" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I used Timeline JS to design an <a href="http://themaneater.com/special-sections/mu-fall-2015" target="_blank">interactive timeline</a> of events leading up to the fall 2015 protests at Mizzou. The timeline received over 200,000 views within the month and was linked to by multiple national outlets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/us/university-of-missouri-system-president-resigns.html" target="_blank">including The New York Times</a>. This piece also won first place in multimedia package at the Missouri College Media Association in April 2016 and is prominently featured on <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">the Timeline JS website</a> as an example.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Accessibility in Greektown (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/tree/master/Accessibility%20in%20Greektown" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I worked with reporters, photographers and graphic designers to design and develop <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/accessibility-in-greektown/" target="_blank">this long form piece</a> about accessibility in Mizzou Greek houses. This piece was an honorable mention for the Associated Collegiate Press’ Multimedia Feature of the Year award in October 2015 as well as first place in investigative reporting from the Missouri College Media Association in April 2016.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Explaining Title IX (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/tree/master/Explaining%20Title%20IX" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I worked alongside a reporter to make a Vox cards-esque <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/explaining-title-ix/" target="_blank">interactive slider</a> to explain what Title IX is. This won an honorable mention for multimedia package from the Missouri College Media Association in April 2016.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Mizzou in Review 2014-15 (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/tree/master/Mizzou%20in%20Review" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I designed and developed <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/mizzou-in-review-2014-15/" target="_blank">this page</a> to compile ‘Mizzou in Review’ content that the entire editorial board helped put together.</p>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
    <h5>The growth of elementary schools in Columbia (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/News-Apps-Final-Project" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I made this <a href="http://qbscarlie.github.io/News-Apps-Final-Project/" target="_blank">line chart</a> as my final project in my spring 2016 Introduction to News Apps class. I utilized code from bl.ocks.org and data from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to build this line chart.</p>
