    <p>I'm Carlie and I currently work as <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5178737002/carlie-procell/" target="_blank">a data journalist for USA TODAY's interactive graphics team</a>, but I've previously worked at <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/author/carlieprocell/" target="_blank">Honolulu Civil Beat</a>, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/" target="_blank">The Dallas Morning News</a>, <a href="https://ire.org/" target="_blank">Investigative Reporters & Editors</a>, <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/" target="_blank">The Columbia Missourian</a> and <a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/" target="_blank">The Shreveport Times</a>.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Whether itâ€™s making maps, analyzing data, designing graphics or developing tools - I want to combine journalism and technology to tell stories in innovative, captivating and impactful ways.</p>
    <br />
    <p>My biggest goal is not just to inform, but to encourage the public to want to stay informed. I also enjoy improving newsroom technologies to make it as easy as possible for journalists to do their jobs.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Below are some of my favorite projects I've developed and designed.</p><br />

    <h3>USA TODAY</h3>
    <p class="projtext">I started on GateHouse Media's Data & Investigations Team in December 2019, and when the Gannett/GateHouse merger happened, I moved over to USA TODAY in early 2020 and started working on the graphics team. The merger is why I have two online staff profiles (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5130644002/carlie-procell/" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5178737002/carlie-procell/" target="_blank">2</a>)! Check out some of my team's top work from <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/12/15/2020-look-year-usa-todays-graphics/6475734002/" target="_blank">2020</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2021/11/26/year-review-2021-usa-today/6360644001/" target="_blank">2021</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2022/12/08/2022-usatoday-graphics-year-in-review/10789310002/" target="_blank">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/12/15/2023-year-in-review-visual-guide/71920351007/" target="_blank">2023</a>!</p>
    <br />
    <p class="projtext">I work on a branch of the graphics team dedicated to interactive graphics, and most of my work involves sourcing, analyzing and visualizing data for national stories and investigations. One of my favorite parts about being on this team is being able to help our local properties within the USA TODAY Network with their stories too!</p>

        <p class="cliptext">I worked with local Massachusetts reporters and the USAT data team on an investigation of police citation data that found police mislabel drivers with Hispanic last names.

    <h3>Honolulu Civil Beat</h3>
    <p class="projtext">I joined Honolulu Civil Beat in December 2018 for a yearlong data fellowship to enhance investigative news stories with more data, maps and graphics. I contributed to about 100 stories in my year there, including a few I took the lead on.</p><br>
    <p class="projtext">Our newsroom <a href="https://awards.journalists.org/entries/honolulu-civil-beat/" target="_blank">won a 2019 national general excellence award</a> from the Online Journalism Awards for our innovative projects and digital presentation, and my graphics and maps played an integral role in two of the three projects cited for the award.

        <p class="cliptext">I helped come up with this story and gathered all the data for it using Census microdata (via <a href="https://ipums.org/" target="_blank">IPUMS</a>), then I created all the graphics in Illustrator while a reporter helped write the text.</p>

        <p class="cliptext">For the Homecoming magazine insert, I created a new style guide to match the magazine and worked with my designers to conceptualize about a dozen festive print graphics about topics like <a href="otherimgs/hoco_stats.png" target="_blank">football stats</a>, <a href="otherimgs/hoco_route.png" target="_blank">the parade route</a>, <a href="otherimgs/hoco_games.png" target="_blank">tailgate games</a> and <a href="otherimgs/hoco_locator.png" target="_blank">locator maps.</a></p>

    <p class="projtext">Also at the Missourian, I worked one semester as a staff graphic designer and two semesters as an education reporter where I focused on data stories. I also worked general assignment shifts where I reported a variety of daily news stories. Here are a few of the graphics I made there:</p>

        <p class="cliptext">I worked with the state government editor to direct a team of reporters who compiled a comprehensive list of lawmakers' stances on an issue, then I created the online presentation for it on our site using an <a href="https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics" target="_blank">NPR daily graphics</a> template and a Highcharts bar chart to summarize the stances.</p>

    <h3>The Dallas Morning News</h3>
    <p class="projtext">I spent the summer of 2017 as the data & interactives intern at The Dallas Morning News. While there, I helped develop a <a href="https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/restaurant-inspections-demo" target="_blank">Django app</a> from back-end to front-end that <a href="https://www.guidelive.com/food-and-drink/2018/04/27/search-restaurant-inspections-health-dallas-fort-worth-cities-cleanliness" target="_blank">tracked restaurant health inspections</a> across Dallas and Tarrant counties. I also made several interactive embeddables, which you can view all <a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects" target="_blank">here</a>. Below are some of them: </p>

        <p class="cliptext">I made this interactive to show basic facts about Greek chapters, along with a picture and quote from each one. I used Handlebars along with the script to connect a Google sheet to an S3 bucket so that the reporter could update information as she acquired it. (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/divine-nine-embed" target="_blank">source code</a>)</a>.</p>

        <p class="cliptitle"><a href="http://interactives.dallasnews.com/embeds/2017/slider-template/" target="_blank">Slider Template</a></p>
        <p class="cliptext">I made this template so that it would be easy for others on the Interactives team to make embeddable sliders for stories to introduce people/places/etc. in a story. This uses the same mechanics as the divine nine interactive to retrieve data from a Google sheet.

        <p class="cliptext"> I made this interactive for a story on summer reading books that high schools were assigning. I used a jQuery plugin to make a series of image sliders where the top image was a synopsis of the book and the image underneath revealed the book cover, title and author (which I made in Illustrator).

        <p class="cliptext">I made this interactive to showcase results from a hazing survey. I wrote some Python to parse the survey results, then built a dynamic bar chart in D3 that's controlled by two drop down menus (and then I filter through the data using lodash.)

        <p class="cliptext">I made several maps using Mapbox and a script that connects Google Sheets to an S3 bucket so that they can be updated by the author whenever needed.

    <h3>The Maneater</h3>
    <p class="projtext">While I was the online development editor at Mizzou's student newspaper, The Maneater, I spent most of my time doing backend development work to make the site run more smoothly and with more capabilities.

        <p class="cliptext">I worked alongside a reporter to make a Vox cards-esque interactive slider with Javascript to explain what Title IX is. This won an honorable mention for multimedia package from the Missouri College Media Association in April 2016.

        <p class="cliptext">I worked as the developer alongside two journalism students for an Alexa Skill for the Reynolds Journalism Institute.

The scraper stores the data in a DynamoDB table which updates via an additional Lambda function.
