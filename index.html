    <p>I'm Carlie and I currently work as a <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/author/carlieprocell/" target="_blank">data fellow at Civil Beat</a> in Honolulu, but I've previously worked at <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/" target="_blank">The Dallas Morning News</a>, <a href="https://ire.org/" target="_blank">Investigative Reporters & Editors</a>, <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/" target="_blank">The Columbia Missourian</a> and <a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/" target="_blank">The Shreveport Times</a>.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Whether itâ€™s making maps, analyzing data, designing graphics or developing apps - I want to combine journalism and technology to tell stories in innovative, captivating and impactful ways.</p>
    <br />
    <p>My biggest goal is not just to inform, but to encourage the public to want to stay informed. I also enjoy improving newsroom technologies to make it as easy as possible for journalists to do their jobs.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Below are some of my favorite projects I've developed and designed over the past few years. Visit my <a href="https://qbscarlie.github.io/otherclips.html">other clips page</a> to see examples of my reporting and video experience.</p><br />

    <h3>Honolulu Civil Beat</h3>
    <p class="projtext">I joined Honolulu Civil Beat in December 2018 for a yearlong data fellowship to enhance investigative news stories with more data, maps and graphics. I worked with reporters to gather, analyze and visualize data for their stories and contributed to about 80 stories, including a few I took the lead on. Our newsroom <a href="https://awards.journalists.org/entries/honolulu-civil-beat/" target="_blank">won a 2019 national general excellence award</a> from the Online Journalism Awards for our innovative projects and digital presentation, and my graphics and maps played an integral role in two of the three projects cited for the award. Below are some of my favorite graphics I've made here: </p>

        <p class="cliptext">To make this gif, I used QGIS to edit the geographic data, then Illustrator and Photoshop to add details and animate it. I also made similar gifs for other stories in <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/hawaii-2040/" target="_blank">the Hawaii 2040 series</a> like <a href="clipz/cb_slr.gif" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>

        <p class="cliptext">I helped come up with this story and gathered all the data for it using Census microdata (via <a href="https://ipums.org/" target="_blank">IPUMS</a>), then I created all the graphics in Illustrator while a reporter helped write the text.</p>

    <h3>The Columbia Missourian</h3>
    <p class="projtext">I spent two semesters at The Columbia Missourian as graphics editor where I directed and assisted a team of students from the journalism school's Information Graphics class in producing <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlieProcell/status/1041300904199290880" target="_blank">award-winning</a> infographics for print and web publication. Between the two classes (one from each semester), we produced about 300 graphics.

        <p class="cliptext">This semester-long series that looked at broadband access across rural Missouri, and we did several graphics for this as well such as the <a href="otherimgs/discon_logo.png" target="_blank">series logo</a>, <a href="otherimgs/discon_map.png" target="_blank">multiple</a> <a href="otherimgs/discon_map2.png" target="_blank">maps</a> and <a href="otherimgs/discon_exp.png" target="_blank">graphic explainers.</a></p>

        <p class="cliptext">For the Homecoming magazine insert, I created a new style guide to match the magazine and worked with my designers to conceptualize about a dozen festive print graphics about topics like <a href="otherimgs/hoco_stats.png" target="_blank">football stats</a>, <a href="otherimgs/hoco_route.png" target="_blank">the parade route</a>, <a href="otherimgs/hoco_games.png" target="_blank">tailgate games</a> and <a href="otherimgs/hoco_locator.png" target="_blank">locator maps.</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="projtext">Also at the Missourian, I worked one semester as a staff graphic designer and two semesters as an education reporter where I focused on data stories. I also worked general assignment shifts where I reported a variety of daily news stories. To see all my stories, click on <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/users/profile/qbscarlie/" target="_blank">my staff profile page here</a>. Here are a few of the graphics I made there:</p>

        <p class="cliptext">I worked with the state government editor to direct a team of reporters who compiled a comprehensive list of lawmakers' stances on an issue, then I created the online presentation for it on our site using an <a href="https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics" target="_blank">NPR daily graphics</a> template and a Highcharts bar chart to summarize the stances.</p>

        <p class="cliptext">For this map, I worked on a team to build a map of Missouri that displayed results from the U.S. presidential and senate races as they came in.

      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>The Dallas Morning News</h3>
    <p class="projtext">I spent the summer of 2017 as the data & interactives intern at The Dallas Morning News. While there, I helped develop a <a href="https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/restaurant-inspections-demo" target="_blank">Django app</a> from back-end to front-end that <a href="https://www.guidelive.com/food-and-drink/2018/04/27/search-restaurant-inspections-health-dallas-fort-worth-cities-cleanliness" target="_blank">tracked restaurant health inspections</a> across Dallas and Tarrant counties. I also made several interactive embeddables, which you can view all <a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects" target="_blank">here</a>. Below are some of them: </p>
    <br>

    <div class="clipgrid">
      <div class="clip1">

        <p class="cliptext">I made this interactive to show basic facts about Greek chapters, along with a picture and quote from each one. I used Handlebars along with the script to connect a Google sheet to an S3 bucket so that the reporter could update information as she acquired it. (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/divine-nine-embed" target="_blank">source code</a>)</a>.</p>

        <p class="cliptitle"><a href="http://interactives.dallasnews.com/embeds/2017/slider-template/" target="_blank">Slider Template</a></p>
        <p class="cliptext">I made this template so that it would be easy for others on the Interactives team to make embeddable sliders for stories to introduce people/places/etc. in a story. This uses the same mechanics as the divine nine interactive to retrieve data from a Google sheet. (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/people-slider-template" target="_blank">source code</a>)</a>.</p>

        <p class="cliptext"> I made this interactive for a story on summer reading books that high schools were assigning. I used a jQuery plugin to make a series of image sliders where the top image was a synopsis of the book and the image underneath revealed the book cover, title and author (which I made in Illustrator).

        <p class="cliptext">I made this interactive to showcase results from a hazing survey. I wrote some Python to parse the survey results, then built a dynamic bar chart in D3 that's controlled by two drop down menus (and then I filter through the data using lodash.) (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/hazing-dashboard" target="_blank">source code</a>)</p>

        <p class="cliptext">I made several maps using Mapbox and a script that connects Google Sheets to an S3 bucket so that they can be updated by the author whenever needed. This one is a step through map of skyscrapers in Dallas over the decades with a tooltip.

    <h3>The Maneater</h3>
    <p class="projtext">While I was the online development editor at Mizzou's student newspaper, The Maneater, I spent most of my time doing backend development work to make the site run more smoothly and with more capabilities. But I also designed and developed many special sections. I highlighted some below: </p>

        <p class="cliptitle"><a href="https://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/explaining-title-ix" target="_blank">Explaining Title IX</a></p>
        <p class="cliptext">I worked alongside a reporter to make a Vox cards-esque interactive slider with Javascript to explain what Title IX is. This won an honorable mention for multimedia package from the Missouri College Media Association in April 2016.

        <p class="cliptext">I designed <a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/" target="_blank">several long form pieces</a> at The Maneater. One was this <a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/awards/2015msoy/" target="_blank">award-winning piece</a> on leadership culture at Mizzou.

        <p class="cliptext">I designed an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MissouriCollegeMedia/posts/1077272995668110" target="_blank">award-winning</a> interactive timeline of events leading up to the fall 2015 protests at Mizzou. The timeline received over 200,000 views within the month and was linked to by multiple national outlets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/us/university-of-missouri-system-president-resigns.html" target="_blank">including The New York Times</a>. This piece is also prominently featured on <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">the Timeline JS website</a> as an example.

        <p class="cliptext">I worked as the developer alongside two journalism students for an Alexa Skill for the Reynolds Journalism Institute. Our skill scrapes articles from their RSS feed based on tags said by the user. I wrote the skill itself in Node.js and implemented it with a Lambda function, and I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/rji_scraper" target="_blank">scraper</a> in Python. The scraper stores the data in a DynamoDB table which updates via an additional Lambda function. I created a how-to guide on how to do the skill <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ps9nj1vcodelpf/HowToAlexa.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a> and our demo for the skill is <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P06OkIJu8TgT_eOqFr9oiccnXrv-61FgnMagxZpp-mA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
