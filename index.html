  <div id="content">
    <p>I'm Carlie and I graduated this May from Mizzou with a degree in data journalism. I've previously worked at <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/" target="_blank">The Dallas Morning News</a>, <a href="https://ire.org/" target="_blank">Investigative Reporters & Editors</a>, <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/" target="_blank">The Columbia Missourian</a> and <a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/" target="_blank">The Shreveport Times</a>.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Whether it’s writing scrapers, analyzing data, designing graphics or developing apps - I want to combine journalism and technology to tell stories in innovative, captivating and impactful ways.</p>
    <br />
    <p>My biggest goal is not just to inform, but to encourage the public to want to stay informed. I also enjoy improving newsroom technologies to make it as easy as possible for journalists to do their job.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Below are some projects I've developed and designed over the past few years:</p><br />

    <h3>Reynolds Journalism Institute</h3>
    <h5>RJI Alexa Skill (<a href="https://github.com/jasminehl/alexaskills" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I spent the Fall 2017 semester working as the developer alongside two journalism students for an Alexa Skill for the Reynolds Journalism Institute. Our skill scrapes articles from their <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/rss" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> based on tags said by the user. I wrote the skill itself in Node.js and implemented it with a Lambda function, and I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/rji_scraper" target="_blank">scraper</a> in Python. The scraper stores the data in a DynamoDB table which updates via an additional Lambda function. I created a how-to guide on how to do the skill <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ps9nj1vcodelpf/HowToAlexa.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>The Dallas Morning News</h3>
    <h5>Restaurant Inspections (<a href="https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/restaurant-inspections-demo" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I helped develop a <a href="http://restaurantinspections.dallasnews.com/" target="_blank">Django app</a> from back-end to front-end that tracks restaurant health inspections across Dallas and Tarrant counties. I wrote several Python scrapers to scrape the data and store the data in a PostgreSQL database. <a href="https://www.guidelive.com/food-and-drink/2018/04/27/search-restaurant-inspections-health-dallas-fort-worth-cities-cleanliness" target="_blank">Here's an article</a> explaining how it works and why we made it.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Maps (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/maps" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I made several maps with Mapbox and a script that connects Google Sheets to an Amazon S3 bucket so the reporter could edit the data. My favorite is <a href="http://interactives.dallasnews.com/embeds/2017/skyline-map/" target="_blank">this one</a> that shows the history of skyscrapers in downtown Dallas.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Divine Nine embeddable (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/divine-nine-embed" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">For <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/life/life/2017/06/08/long-college-divine-nine-fraternities-sororities-lifeline-black-members" target="_blank">a story</a> about the Dallas Divine Nine, I worked with a reporter to develop an embeddable that showed facts about each chapter.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Book slider (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/DMN-Projects/tree/master/book-slider" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I teamed up with another intern to develop <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2017/07/11/high-school-flashback-can-name-summers-reading-assignments-just-books-plots" target="_blank">this project</a> that tests reader's knowledge of summer reading books that North Texas schools were assigning. I used a jQuery plugin to make a series of image sliders where the top image was a synopsis of the book and the image underneath revealed the book cover, title and author.</p>

    <h3>The Columbia Missourian</h3>
    <h5>2016 election map (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/2016-Election-Map" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">For this map, I worked on a team to build a map of Missouri that displayed results from the U.S. presidential and senate races as they came in. I built the map with TopoJSON files and used D3 and Underscore.js to connect the data to it.</p>

    <h3>The Maneater</h3>
    <!-- <p class="projtext"></p> -->
    <h5>Special sections (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/" target="_blank">full list</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">While I was the online development editor at Mizzou's student newspaper, The Maneater, I spent most of my time doing backend development work to make the site run more smoothly and with more capabilities. But I also designed and developed many special sections. I highlighted some below.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Leadership Culture (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/tree/master/Leadership%20Culture" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">Most of the special sections I made were long form pieces. One example was <a href="https://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/leadership-culture" target="_blank">this piece</a> on leadership culture at Mizzou.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>A Historic Fall at MU (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/blob/master/A%20Historic%20Fall/mufall15.html" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I used Timeline JS to design an <a href="http://themaneater.com/special-sections/mu-fall-2015" target="_blank">interactive timeline</a> of events leading up to the fall 2015 protests at Mizzou. The timeline received over 200,000 views within the month and was linked to by multiple national outlets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/us/university-of-missouri-system-president-resigns.html" target="_blank">including The New York Times</a>. This piece also won first place in multimedia package at the Missouri College Media Association in April 2016 and is prominently featured on <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">the Timeline JS website</a> as an example.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Explaining Title IX (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/tree/master/Explaining%20Title%20IX" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I worked alongside a reporter to make a Vox cards-esque <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/explaining-title-ix/" target="_blank">interactive slider</a> to explain what Title IX is. This won an honorable mention for multimedia package from the Missouri College Media Association in April 2016.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Mizzou in Review 2014-15 (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/Maneater-Special-Sections/tree/master/Mizzou%20in%20Review" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I designed and developed <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/mizzou-in-review-2014-15/" target="_blank">this page</a> to compile ‘Mizzou in Review’ content that the entire editorial board helped put together.</p>
    <br /><br />
    <!-- <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
    <h5>The growth of elementary schools in Columbia (<a href="https://github.com/qbscarlie/News-Apps-Final-Project" target="_blank">source code</a>)</h5>
    <p class="projtext">I made this <a href="http://qbscarlie.github.io/News-Apps-Final-Project/" target="_blank">line chart</a> as my final project in my spring 2016 Introduction to News Apps class. I utilized code from bl.ocks.org and data from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to build this line chart.</p> -->
