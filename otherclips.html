    <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <h5>The Columbia Missourian</h5>
    <p class="cliptext">I've spent two semesters as an education reporter at the Columbia Missourian. I liked to focus on data stories about topics like <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/k12_education/map-scores-show-columbia-middle-school-students-outpace-state-in/article_a88088ec-8733-11e6-9c39-23006d2e8540.html" target="_blank">test scores</a> and <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/k12_education/columbia-school-board-candidates-release-campaign-finance-reports/article_9c4bc126-1b44-11e8-a011-0f103e205075.html" target="_blank">campaign finance reports</a>, but I also worked general assignment shifts where I reported a variety of daily news stories. To view my profile and all the stories I've written at the Missourian, <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/users/profile/qbscarlie/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<br />
    <h5>The Shreveport Times</h5>
    <p class="cliptext">During the summer of 2015 after my first year of college, I was an intern at my hometown paper The Shreveport Times and reported a few stories while I was there like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/life/community/2015/06/16/corner-commerce/28799161/" target="_blank">Bossier intersection sees redevelopment</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2015/07/02/caddo-men-festival-plaza/29649695/" target="_blank">Caddo men wed in Festival Plaza</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2015/06/30/peta-unleashes-chicken-virtual-reality/29518663/" target="_blank">PETA unleashes chicken virtual reality</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cliptext">I also taught reporters in the newsroom how to better utilize tools within their CMS (Presto) and experimented with using third party apps for storytelling, like making a <a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2015/06/10/red-river-flood-timeline/71006066/" target="_blank">timeline about a river flooding</a> or a <a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/entertainment/2015/05/26/sunflower-trail-festival-gilliam/27959525/" target="_blank">map for a local festival route</a>.</p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <h5>The Columbia Missourian</h5>
    <p class="cliptext">As the graphics editor at the Missourian, I coordinate with students, reporters and editors to make <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/visuals/graphics/" target="_blank">graphics for daily publication</a>. I also play a large role in helping with data analysis and coordinating visuals and presentation for larger projects at the Missourian, like <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/following-missouri-s-higher-education-bill/article_2a59c10a-18c2-11e8-b9eb-ab2dd00ed4a1.html" target="_blank">this one</a> explaining the process of a budget bill and <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/lack-of-broadband-puts-missouri-behind/article_097fc1cc-efe2-11e7-99b2-273eaf367ba9.html?utm_source=SocialNewsDesk&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=SND_scheduled_post" target="_blank">this one</a> looking at how rural communities are affected by slow, unreliable internet connection.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>Mapping For Stories: A Data Journalism Guide</h5>
    <p class="cliptext">I designed the cover for <a href="https://store.ire.org/products/mapping-for-stories-a-data-journalism-guide" target="_blank">IRE's newest mapping book</a>, which published in spring 2018. I also test drove all the lessons, copy edited the book and researched and wrote about mapping examples for the appendix.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>EPIC Literary Journal</h5>
    <p class="cliptext">In spring 2016, I designed <a href="https://issuu.com/qbscarlie/docs/epicforissuu" target="_blank">Mizzou's undergraduate literary journal</a> using InDesign.</p>
